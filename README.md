# ink! in a Multi-Chain World

## Alternative Titles
ink! as a gateway to the multi-chain future
Urban Planning in the Paraverse with ink!

## Outline
- What is the multi-chain thesis
- What does the multi-chain future look like?
    - Hybrid chains
- Why might you still want to use smart contracts (smart contract advantaged)?
    - Sandboxed execution
    - Lower deployment costs
    - Easy bootstrapping
        - Collators, community, blockspace aquisition
- What role do smart contracts play in this world?
    - Experimentation
    - API dogfooding
    - More efficient use of blockspace? How?
        - Density, localized economic activity
        - Housing analogy, residential, suburbs, embedded
- What does this look like in the context of Polkadot?
    - Smart contracts as second class citizens
    - Automatically get access to a whole community of chains
        - Not just app-specific chains, but their contracts
- Why is ink! uniquely suited to thrive in this environment?
    - Native Rust tooling available
    - Chain extensions
- What are some things we still need to achieve this?
    - A pathway for solo-SC chains ("pure ink! chains")
        - Smart contracts as AWS Lambdas?
    - A pathway from contract to runtime
    - Native XCM integration
